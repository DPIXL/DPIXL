# Somethin bout me i guess
- Hi, I'm EditBySteve (alias EbSteve, EbSteveDev)!
- I'm 15 years old
- Currently been learning C# and Unity Game Engine for a year, but I wanna move to C or C++ soon...
- Right now (May 2022) still in Elementary School, but I was already accepted to an IT highschool (SSŠVT)
- I'm looking forward to learn more programming, as I want to be a something-C-related programmer one day!
